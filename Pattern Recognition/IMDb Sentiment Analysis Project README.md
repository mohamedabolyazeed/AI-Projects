   - **Output**: A table with `review` (text) and `sentiment` (positive/negative) columns.

### **7. Preprocessing the Text 🧹**
   - **What Happens**: We clean the reviews to prepare them for modeling by:
     - Removing HTML tags (e.g., `<br />`).
     - Converting text to lowercase.
     - Removing punctuation and special characters.
     - Removing stopwords (common words like “the,” “is”).
     - Applying lemmatization to reduce words to their root form (e.g., “running” → “run”).
   - **Tools Used**: NLTK, Scikit-learn (for text utilities).
   - **Code Spotlight** (assumed, as preprocessing is a standard step):
     ```python
     import re
     from nltk.corpus import stopwords
     from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
     from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

     stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
     lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

     def preprocess_text(text):
         text = re.sub(r'<.*?>', '', text)  # Remove HTML tags
         text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)  # Remove punctuation
         text = text.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
         tokens = word_tokenize(text)  # Tokenize
         tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
         return ' '.join(tokens)

     df['cleaned_review'] = df['review'].apply(preprocess_text)
     ```
   - **Why It’s Cool**: This is like editing raw footage into a polished scene, making the text ready for the spotlight.
   - **Output**: A new column (`cleaned_review`) with clean, processed text.

### **8. Feature Extraction 🎨**
   - **What Happens**: We convert the cleaned text into numerical features using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to capture the importance of words.
   - **Tools Used**: Scikit-learn (`TfidfVectorizer`).
   - **Code Spotlight** (assumed, as feature extraction is a standard step):
     ```python
     from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

     vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
     X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['cleaned_review'])
     y = df['sentiment'].map({'positive': 1, 'negative': 0})
     ```
   - **Why It’s Cool**: This is like turning dialogue into a visual effects sequence—words become numbers that machines can understand!
   - **Output**: A sparse matrix `X` of TF-IDF features and a binary `y` (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

### **9. Splitting the Data 🎬**
   - **What Happens**: We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate our model’s performance.
   - **Tools Used**: Scikit-learn (`train_test_split`).
   - **Code Spotlight** (assumed, as data splitting is standard):
     ```python
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

     X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
     ```
   - **Why It’s Cool**: This is like dividing the cast into rehearsal and performance groups, ensuring our model learns and performs well.
   - **Output**: Training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and testing (`X_test`, `y_test`) sets.

### **10. Visualizing Sentiment Distribution 📊**
   - **What Happens**: We calculate and visualize the number of positive and negative reviews in the training data using a bar plot.
   - **Tools Used**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy.
   - **Code Spotlight**:
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     import seaborn as sns

     positive_count = y_train.sum()
     negative_count = len(y_train) - positive_count

     print(f"Positive reviews in training data: {positive_count}")
     print(f"Negative reviews in training data: {negative_count}")

     plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
     sns.countplot(x=y_train, palette="coolwarm")
     plt.title("Sentiment Distribution in Training Data")
     plt.xlabel("Sentiment (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive)")
     plt.ylabel("Count")
     plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.6)
     plt.tight_layout()
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Why It’s Cool**: This is the blockbuster moment, turning raw counts into a vibrant visual that tells the story of sentiment balance.
   - **Output**: A bar plot and printed counts of positive/negative reviews.

### **11. Training the Model 🤖**
   - **What Happens**: We train a **Logistic Regression** model to classify reviews as positive or negative.
   - **Tools Used**: Scikit-learn (`LogisticRegression`).
   - **Code Spotlight** (assumed, as modeling is the final step):
     ```python
     from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

     model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```
   - **Why It’s Cool**: This is the climactic scene where our model learns to read emotions like a seasoned critic!
   - **Output**: A trained Logistic Regression model ready to predict sentiments.

### **12. Evaluating the Model 🎯**
   - **What Happens**: We test the model on the test set and calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - **Tools Used**: Scikit-learn (`accuracy_score`, `classification_report`).
   - **Code Spotlight** (assumed, as evaluation is standard):
     ```python
     from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

     y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
     print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
     print("Classification Report:")
     print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
     ```
   - **Why It’s Cool**: This is the review phase, where we see how well our model performs on unseen data—like getting critic reviews for our movie!
